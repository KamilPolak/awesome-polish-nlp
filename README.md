## Tools

### Stemming

- [morfologik-stemming](https://github.com/morfologik/morfologik-stemming) (BSD-3) - dictionary based, doesn't support out-of-vocabulary words
- [stempel](http://www.getopt.org/stempel/) (Apache-style) - seems ancient, but working; can handle some out-of-vocabulary words
- paper: [A Survey of Freely Available Polish Stemmers](http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dweiss/site/publications/download/ltc_092_weiss_2.pdf) (2005)
